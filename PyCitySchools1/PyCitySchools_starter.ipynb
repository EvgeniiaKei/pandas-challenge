    "The district summary DataFrame show that throughtout 15 schools with 39,170 total student and over 24.5 millon dollars, students are more successful at reading than math. From the collected data we can conclude that higher spending (per student), does not result in higher test scores. It can also be concluded that small (<1000) schools have better overall passing then large (2000 - 5000) schools. Summariing all the above points, we can conclude the most effective school with average costs is griffin Hight school. (% Overall passing 81.335; budget per student $625)\n",
